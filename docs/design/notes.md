# Things to address

* Should a user be able to specify DGNs in a config file
  * For example Spyder has their own "custom" DGN and other vendors might do the same
* A user SHOULD be able to specify instance names in a config file - including overriding existing ones
* Maybe bitfields should be packed into a single byte vs split out
*
